      <p>
        I am a Frontend Engineer with a strong interest in creating modern and
        user-friendly web applications. My main focus is frontend development,
        including building scalable and high-performance solutions using React,
        TypeScript, and Next.js. I also have experience with Redux, TanStack
        Query, and GraphQL, which helps me manage application state and work
        with APIs effectively. In addition, I have some experience in backend
        development with Node.js and NestJS. This helps me understand the full
        development cycle and work better with backend teams.
